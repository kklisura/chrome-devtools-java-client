 * Keep in sync with MediaLogMessageLevel We are currently keeping the message level 'error'
 * separate from the PlayerError type because right now they represent different things, this one
 * being a DVLOG(ERROR) style log message that gets printed based on what log level is selected in
 * the UI, and the other is a representation of a media::PipelineStatus object. Soon however we're
 * going to be moving away from using PipelineStatus for errors and introducing a new error type
 * which should hopefully let us integrate the error log level into the PlayerError type.
